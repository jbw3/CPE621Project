problem first
big picture solution (grandma can understnad)
    diagrams (show how solution integrates)

existing products...what niche do they miss?

what methods were used to test the solution?


- original problem
- big picture solution (grandma)
    * diagrams
- existing products
    * what niche area do they miss?
- solution details
- issues we faced
- modified project (capacitance sensor)
- methods to test
- demo?


* Each time I run bleadvert without restarting, another ImmAlert svc is added
* I restarted (atz), and my ImmAlert svcs were removed

CURRENT PLAN:

Arm state characteristic - 0xFEED
    - [characteristic attribute]
    - VALUE attribute
        - (Read/Write)
        - 0 - Disarmed, 1 - Armed
    - CCCD attribute
        - bit n: 0 - notify off, 1 - notify on

Alarm state characteristic - 0xFACE
    - [characteristic attribute]
    - VALUE attribute
        - (Read/Write/Notify if armed)
        - 0 – No alarm
        - 1 – Alarm
    - CCCD attribute
        - bit n: 0 - notify off (disarmed) 1 - notify on (armed)

SYSTEM ACTIONS:

1) Connect

1.b) Setup

    1. App writes CCCD values as desired...

2) Arm
    1. App writes to Arm state char.
        - Device notifies if CCCD set

3) Disarm a Device

    1. App writes Arm state char. (to disarm)

4) Turn Alarm On

    1. On detection of alarm condition...
        - device writes Alarm state char.
        - if CCCD set, device notifies App of alarm state (1x)
        - device performs alarm state actions, if any...

5) Turn Alarm Off

    1. App may disarm the device
    2. OR, App writes Alarm state char. (to turn off alarm, but remain armed)

CAPDAC:

- CIN2 +/- used in differential mode
- use status reg to detect new data ready?
- STATUS:RDYCAP = 0 -> Capacitive channel conversion finished, unread data ready
- CAP DATA: capacitive channel output data (24 bits)
- CAP DATA: all 3B should be read in 1 I2C tx b/c new data might come in and
corrupt 1 or 2 bytes...
- CAP SETUP
- EXC SETUP (turn on EXC_A)
- CONFIGURATION
